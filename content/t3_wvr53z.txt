What's the weirdest theory you've ever heard for a popular case?

The theory doesn't even have to be implausible, just one that you'd never heard before and is kind of out there.

I don't remember where, but somewhere I saw someone say that Pamela Buckley and James Freund, previously known as the Sumter County Does, were killed by the Zodiac killer. that was hilarious to me, they obviously didn't do any sort of research and just named a killer who went after couples.

I also scoff a bit when people try to connect Donald 'Pee-Wee' Gaskins to any number of cases in South Carolina, and the surrounding area. I think it's pretty obvious that he was just confessing to as many cases as the cops would give him the description of.
