I saw on the Canada subreddit that their healthcare system is "crumbling". 

https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/vy18ty/its_unanimous_canadas_health_care_is_crumbling/

There seems to be a ton of bickering about the reasons in the comments but not many unbiased takes. As far as I can tell, it has something to do with dwindling numbers of qualified doctors and quality care despite high government expenditures. 

As an American who constantly sees comments regarding how our healthcare should be more like Canada's (and who agrees our own healthcare is shit), this development does not seem to support that. Often those comments come from Canadians who seem to be proud of their healthcare system. But the issues mentioned above seem to be in-line with Republican talking points about socialized medicine. Can someone give me an unbiased explanation?
