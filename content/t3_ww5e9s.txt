I was writing an essay for one of my course at university called Gender, Crimes and Society and the essay question I was answering is:

"Drawing on criminological theories, explain how the media's portrayal of masculinity and femininity contribute to the ways that the different genders are treated by the criminal justice system"

I waited until I had finished my essay in order to post this as I didn't want to seem like i was asking help for my homework. 

However, it is an interesting question. Are there any cases where you believe that the media has changed the view of a case so fundamentally that it changed the way people are viewed within the justice system?
