Are you one of those people that are always late? Like, constantly, chronically late? To the point where your friends start to give you a fake earlier time just to make sure you’re not late?

Well, I was one of those people. I still am, actually. But not through any choice of mine.

It started off, weirdly enough, as a simple technological glitch. I would have a time set on my phone, go to my meet up or appointment and find that my phone was running a few minutes behind. Honestly, in this day and age, I didn’t think anyone could have the wrong time on their phone.

But then it started to get worse. After a month, I found that I was half an hour late for everything. After two months, I was coming into work a full hour late.

I tried everything. I adjusted the time on my phone. Changed my time zone. I started actively coming in earlier than what the time was. But nothing changed.

Eventually I stopped using the time on my phone. I bought a new watch, an analogue watch, and matched it with the time in the giant clock in the city. After the time on my watch was matched exactly with that of the giant clock, I turned away. I closed my eyes and counted to ten. “Please,” I thought to myself, “Please be the right time.”

I turned around and looked at the giant clock. My heart sank. Two and a half hours had passed. 

I didn’t know what to do or who to turn to. I wandered the streets of the city. My friends had all stopped talking to me at this point. I apparently wouldn’t return texts for days. My tardiness at work had gotten me fired. 

And so with nowhere to be I simply walked the city. Every now and then I would go back to the giant clock to look at the time. 

I can’t remember now when all of this started or how long I’ve walked the city. But the giant clock reminds me.

The last time I checked it’s been 6,312,200 minutes since I started walking. I’m twelve years late.
