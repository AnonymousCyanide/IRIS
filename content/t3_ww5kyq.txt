With almost every missing person case, there’s the idea the person just left to start a new life. (I’m not talking about cases where someone has left and not able to return because of a mental health crisis.) I’m thinking of a case like [Crystal Haag](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/two-decades-after-vanishing-her-daughter-suddenly-showed-up-with-children-a-new-identity--and-speaking-spanish/2019/03/10/1b9fbd88-3f75-11e9-a0d3-1210e58a94cf_story.html). Crystal’s family thought she was a happy and content fourteen year old. One day disappeared. Her family notified police and thought she would never have left by choice. Crystal actually went to New York and started a new life under an assumed identity. She changed her age and took a new name. She became a member of the community and started a family. Crystal was reunited with her family more than twenty years later. What are some other cases where you think the missing person is safe and left of their own free will?
