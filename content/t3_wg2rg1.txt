Plagarism is defined as the act of taking someone else’s work and passing them off as your own. 

Recently there has been a noticeable increase of plagiarised stuff here on SSS. People are literally taking old, successful stories and reposting them as their own. No mention of the original author, nothing.

And I don’t mean being inspired by them or giving their ideas a new light or twist or something like that.

I mean literally reposting them word-by-word. Copy and pasting them.

**I would like to remind everyone that we have a zero-tolerance policy on blatant plagarism here. This includes not just directly copying and pasting stories word-by-word, but also very minute changes, like simply changing the names of the characters in the story while still keeping the style and plot.**

**So far I have been warning these people for first offences. Not going to name names, you know who you are. But no more.**

**From now on, any case of straight, blatant plagiarism will result in an instant permaban**

**Consider this post your only warning.**
