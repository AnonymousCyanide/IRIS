20-year-old Rachel Good was last seen around 7:30 pm on October 18, 2003 after hanging out with friends in the parking lot across the street from the Elkton Volunteer Fire Department. Rachel told friends she was heading home, and her car was later found there. The next day, Rachel’s best friend contacted her mother and told her that they couldn’t find Rachel, so her mother Brenda and Rachel's brother decided to report her missing.

When Brenda Brown reported her daughter’s disappearance to the Elkton Police Department in 2003, she says the officer who took her statement couldn’t stop shaking. “I have never seen anyone shake like that. He could barely hold his ink pen in his hand, and he only wrote a couple of lines.” 

The officer who took the report was a man named Adam Williams. He came across as a caring officer who was empathetic toward Brenda, a mother who was going through every parent’s worst nightmare. He told Brenda that if she ever needed anything that she could call him, and that he would help in any way he could. 

At the time of Rachel’s disappearance, Adam Williams was 22 years old. He was also the Elkton Police Department’s lead investigator. As such, he was the lead on Rachel’s case for the first four days of the investigation. During this time, Rachel’s family witnessed him entering Rachel’s apartment and collecting evidence. Obviously, this is a totally normal thing for the lead investigator to do. Except for one thing: her family soon found letters that indicated that Rachel and Adam Williams were in a romantic relationship. 

Williams, of course, hadn't disclosed this fact, which is why he was allowed to investigate the case. The main reason he was keeping this relationship to himself? He was married. And to further complicate matters, Rachel was pregnant. According to some of Rachel’s family members, when she told Adam that she was pregnant, he wanted her to get an abortion. He even gave her the money for it. Rachel not only didn’t get the abortion, but she threatened to tell Adam’s wife about them, and took his money and spent it on other things. 

The investigation was turned over to Virginia State Police. In November of 2003, about a month after Rachel’s disappearance, Williams submitted his letter of resignation to the Elkton Police Department– effective January 2004. Police searched his home, and in December of 2003, Williams was put on administrative leave until his resignation took effect. As soon as it did, he moved down to Louisiana.

In September of 2004, 11 months after her disappearance, Rockingham County Commonwealth's Attorney Marsha Garst convened a special grand jury to look into Rachel’s disappearance. One one hand, this was almost a year after her disappearance, which seems like a long time, but on the other hand, Garst seemed confident, telling The Daily News Leader, "We have significant evidence, and we want to move the case along.” She even boldly said that an indictment was, “certain.” However, no indictment would be handed down.

In 2010, seven years had passed since Rachel had last been seen, so her family had her declared legally dead. In October of 2012, Rachel’s father filed a wrongful death suit against the Town of Elkton, Former Police Chief Richard Pullen, and Adam Williams. In February of 2014, lawyers representing Elkton asked for the suit to be dismissed. It was, and Elkton and Pullen were officially off the hook. 

Over the years, the grand jury was reconvened a few more times, but with no real progress. Seven years after her disappearance, Rachel was declared legally dead. The civil suit has been re-filed and is currently making its way through the court system. There has been no movement on the criminal case, however, and Adam Williams remains free.
