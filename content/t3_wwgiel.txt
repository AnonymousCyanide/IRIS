I follow this subreddit Toronto Real Estate and almost every other thread is about hating on real estate agents, demanding they get paid low commission and treating them like they’re parasites. I had a real estate agent help me find my current home and was happy with the service. I tried finding my home on my own and it sucked, which was why I hired a real estate agent.  Yes, the real estate agent was admittedly pushy at times when it came to bidding wars (more of a real estate market issue than anything) but they were real with me by pointing out flaws with the home or the materials used to construct it. Why do people hate real estate agents so much?
