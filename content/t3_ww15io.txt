 

I feel like I'm about to break down. My mom and dad are getting a divorce. My siblings are all moving out. I don't have a good enough job to get my own place. I don't really know what's going to happen. I really value my family being all together, but it just seems like everyone is going their own way now. I don't know if this is God's will or just the devil's plan for division. If I have to end up living somewhere on my own I don't know if I can make it. I don't think I can handle living away from all of my family, but it seems like I don't really have a choice. I don't have a girlfriend or a wife either to spend time with.

I don't understand why this is happening. I know that me and my siblings would grow up eventually and get their own house and start their own family, but why is everyone moving so far away? We all love each other. We're a close family. I still have good friends where I currently live, but even they are starting to get married and they spend less and less time with me. I think at this time I should draw nearer and nearer to Jesus. That's the right answer, but I don't even feel close to God much anymore. I feel like He isn't talking to me.

I know this is off-topic, but lately I've been scrolling through old messages and I've been cringing and feeling ashamed at a lot of the attempts I made to ask out and flirt with girls through social media. I did it a lot more than I remember. I think I might just delete all of my social media. My family is going their own way, I'm not any closer to getting a girlfriend or a wife, and I just don't feel God's love much anymore.

TL;DR I can't handle life
