# ...said the carny at the booth full of fun prizes, which drew Anthony's attention. Upon further inspection, multiple people could be seen tied to a spinning wheel. All of which with duct tape over their mouths.

# 

**"Excuse me sir, is this even legal?"**

"Of course it is! All these sorry souls were to be put to death anyway."

&amp;#x200B;

# The carny then handed Anthony a shotgun.

&amp;#x200B;

"Kill *any* of them, you win a prize."

&amp;#x200B;

# The carny then pointed to a box covered in question marks, mixed in with the prizes.

&amp;#x200B;

"*However*, if you manage to kill the man in the red shirt, you win the mystery box!"

&amp;#x200B;

# Anthony saw the man the carny was speaking of. The strangest thing was that he was positive he's seen him in a missing person's report on the news. Then again, it was probably just him.

# First shot, Anthony missed the man in the red shirt, killing someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

"Tough luck kid. But hey, at least you killed someone. Now, which prize do you want?"

**"Actually, let me try again. I want that mystery box."**

&amp;#x200B;

# Anthony kept trying and trying. Blowing almost all the dollars out of his wallet, as well as the heads off the felons.

# Until the only one left was the one with the red shirt.

&amp;#x200B;

"This is your *very* last chance, kid. I've gotta pack up and get out of the state ASAP."

**"But the carnival doesn't leave for another 2 d-"**

"Last chance!"

&amp;#x200B;

# Anthony kept his shotgun steady and his eye on the man. With the pull of the trigger...

&amp;#x200B;

# ...the man's chest exploded with blood and shattered ribs. He was dead!

&amp;#x200B;

"Well done, kid! Your the winner of the sought-after mystery box!"

&amp;#x200B;

# The carny handed Anthony the box and began packing up almost immediately.

# Anthony ripped the lid open, excited to see what was worth killing half-a-dozen people for!

# It was a bouncy ball.

# Anthony turned back around to see nothing but an empty booth.
