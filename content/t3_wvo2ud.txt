I have lived a life in the dark.

I never knew parents, or friday night television, or the feeling of the sun setting on your skin. 

They say my skin wouldn’t withstand something like that anyway. That’s why they won’t let me out. That’s one of the reasons. 

Apparently I’m defective. Part of my defect is understanding what that means in the first place, to be broken. Or even to be. 

The men in the coats say I shouldn’t understand them, or be able to talk back. 
“Something to iron out”. 
“In the next generation.”

I have seen myself before, in the reflective surfaces on the cell. My skin is pale, but I’m healthy (so they say): black hair, wide eyes, weak jawline. I’m well-fed. I wonder what they feed me.

I’ve never really tried to leave before, partially because I understand the consequences. There are others (so they say), and one tried to end their life inside the cell. They were put “on ice”, and I think that’s what’s happening to all of us soon.

Or it would have, except I’ve been taken out. The gas filled the room and it all went dark. And I’m on a table. Bright lights, not sun, too harsh, too cold. I was numb, but feeling returned, and I turn my head to the man on the other table. 

The man with the black hair, wide eyes, weak jawline. A man in a coat is there, they’re talking. They don’t notice me as I listen.

“The procedure is painless?”
“Of course, it’s just like any other surgery. Your Other is under anesthesia as well, if you’re worried about-“
“No no, I want to do this. I’m amazed how similar he looks.”
“We pride ourselves on our accuracy. His kidney is your kidney, and it’ll feel like nothing changed.”
This seemed to please the man, and he lay back in the chair. I too layed back as the man in the coat came over and rested his hand on my arm, feeling the veins.

“Miraculous. Every one of you.”
Something is injected into me. 
I stare up at the light as it fades, and imagine the sun setting on my skin.
