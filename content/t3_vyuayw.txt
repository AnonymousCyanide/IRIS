For a few days now, my girlfriend and I have been using this app called "noteit". It allows you to send each other little drawings/notes that are then sent to your partner's phone. My girlfriend would regularly send me little good morning drawings and I would draw something back. It was kind of funny because my drawing skills are really bad. We have been sending notes back and forth to each other for the past few days. 

Yesterday she came over to my house and we had dinner together. After that we went to my bed. We were just cuddling and being on our phones when I got a new note, I started giggling because my girlfriend was literally next to me. I opened it up and saw a doodle of the two of us sitting on my bed, just like we did in real life. 

I thought it was cute, i hit the "New Note" button and started my drawing. Since my girlfriend was staying the night, I decided to draw us snuggling in bed, and when it was done, I clicked the "Sent Message" button. A few minutes had passed and my girlfriend opened the message. I saw her smiling at her phone as she made a new drawing.

Moments later I saw the drawing pop up on my phone, it was two stick figures kissing. 'Aww' I thought to myself. I kissed my girlfriend on the cheek and proceeded to scroll on tiktok. Not 5 seconds later I received another note, Hmm that's weird. She had just sent me one.

I opened it and I swear my heart stopped for 2 seconds. It was the bloodiest drawing I had ever seen in my life, it was way too realistic. It was both of us, cut into what seemed like a thousand pieces. 

I immediately grabbed my girlfriend's phone to see if she drew it, nothing. She was just scrolling through her Instagram. The noteit app includes a feature that allows you to view all your previous notes. I opened the app on her phone and checked her history. 

The note was not there.
