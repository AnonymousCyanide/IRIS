**[WP] You have the ability to stop time, but when you do the world is suddenly populated with strange creatures that hunt you. Once you start time again, they disappear.**

"Breathe, goddammit," Alya whispered to herself, "just breathe." She tried her best, but it was getting harder to calm herself down with each passing *Shift*. It wasn't that she wasn't used to it, but it was that the freezes were getting longer, and with it, the creatures were getting trickier.

She heard the *thump* echoing through the alley and then the signature scrap of metal against the concrete ground. Whatever the Extion was holding this freeze was massive and it had certainly done it's homework. Alya sighed, while the Extion was the tracker, she had taken precautions this time around. Swapped cities, disposed of her old clothes and anything else that could carry her scent. She even adopted a cat, who was still mid-lick back in her apartment on 7th.

Now, she was halfway across town, counting down the minutes until the *Shift* was over. They were harder to control and even though the multitudes of Aura's were easy enough to kill, the other creatures were the issues. Extion could hurt her, but it was just one of several dozen trackers across the globe.

She turned her head down the alley, trying to make out the shape of the Extion as the scrapping grew louder. As her eyes adjusted to the light beaming from the road, she saw it, four horns tilted upwards, a set of wings protruding from it's back, sharp and angular. One of its arms was weighted, slumped and dragging across the ground in long, sharp screeches. Every other step it took, the arm lifted momentarily, before the screeching returned. 'Number seven,' she thought, as she had named each Extion she encountered. 'That's not good.'

She looked down to her watch where the green hue of the timer stared back. **00:03:43** blinked back at her. They had found her two minutes faster than last *Shift* and Alya wondered how -- it should've taken longer. 'Much longer,' she thought.

Then she heard a second thump to her right, where she had planned her exit. The sound was muffled by a third thump, coming higher above her. She didn't have time to react, the moment she looked up, she saw it. The leader, by the way she had figured it over the years. Twelve-foot wingspan, eight horns, and the largest of the Extions. She didn't call this one 'Number One,' rather he was the Herald. The last time he had been seen, so had Vylken -- the Speaker.

"Seven years," was words from the first voice she had heard in sixteen hours. It could speak to her when near, but this time, it felt like it came from her own thoughts. As if the voice had pierced her soul and found its way into her. "That was the last time we had seen each other."

She didn't bother to wait, she turned left and started to run. There was a fence, but Alya quickly jumped, hurdled, and was on the other side of it. A moment later, the scrapping turned into thumping as the creatures made their move.

Alya ran. She couldn't fight three Extions, let alone the Speaker with them. She turned into the street. There, cars were frozen in place, dozens of people in mid-walk, static as the rain that fell from the sky was in stasis. 'Fuck,' she thought. Nothing had been set up. No safe-house, no defense system. 

Alya thought she had time and the only way they could have tracked her--

She felt an arm on her shoulder, and she double-backed, almost screaming. "No," was the human voice that came.

Alya turned to face another, like her, a person walking out of time. "I was afraid there was another here," the man said, his face hidden behind a black mask, but she could see his eyes -- dark, void, like hers. "Now they have us both. Time?"

Alya didn't hesitate. Although it was the first time there was another human with her in the *Shift*, she couldn't bother asking questions with the Extions on her tail. She held up her watch. **00:01:57** blinked rapidly.

"We're not synced. You have time," the man said. He was carrying something in his hand.

'No,' Alya thought, 'his hand is like theirs.' And it was in that moment she noticed his slouching, the way he hung on his side.

"Run, I will hold them." He said, holding his own watch, which blinked **00:13:46** back at her.

"I have questions," she said, already moving.

"And you'll find answers. Soon," he said. "You're not alone."

And then he was gone, running down the alley, scrapping his arm against the ground, the wall, bringing it up into the air and charging at Number Seven.

Alya ran. She didn't know what it meant, only that there were others. And if that was the case, maybe a way to protect against the creatures during the *Shifts*.

'His arm,' she thought. It could truly only mean one thing, but she pushed the thought from her head. She'd get home, start a new life again. She had the money to do so.

But she'd seek out an Extion this time. Try to find out what it meant and more importantly, what her future held.

She looked down at her own arms. 'Still human,' she thought. 

Then she wondered how much time she truly had left.
