For the record, [mythical creatures](https://redd.it/wejsog) and [goals](https://redd.it/wqeg8d) are the two topics of this month's Talking Tuesdays and two separate topics, not some weird [dragon-playing-football hybrid](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/G1D22H/acrylic-illustration-of-cute-little-dragon-dinosaur-football-commentator-G1D22H.jpg).

Anyway, welcome to tasks....

# How Does This Work?

For those unfamiliar with the concept, each month you have four tasks. Two of these are based on the month's Talking Tuesday posts, the other two, you set yourself based on your own writing aims.

You wanna just write 500 words and get some writing done, great. Do you want get a  movie deal converting your writing prompts into a blockbuster? Great.  You want to just to read a book about writing? Cool. Whatever you want.  That's the idea. They're *your* tasks to improve *your* writing. You know what you need. It's a race against yourself, not others.

We're just here for the accountability and support.

On the following month's post, join in the comments below to let us know how you got on!

# The Tasks

Our [tutoring discussion this month](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/wejsog/ot_talking_tuesday_tutoring_mythical_beasts/) discussed all things mythical as we learned that a selkie is not a breed of chicken and a nixie is not just a typo of pixie (boy did I look stupid when I corrected GingerQuill off-script). Perhaps unsurprisingly then, your first mod task this month is **to write a story involving a mythical beast**.

This can be for any r/WritingPrompts prompt or feature (e.g. Theme Thursday, SEUS, Follow Me Friday) or for any r/shortstories weekly feature post.

However, to make it *slightly challenging*, I am going to say you cannot write a story about any of the more standard interpretations of: dragons, vampires, mermaids, or werewolves. You can use one of those if you push the classic folklore boundaries a bit - e.g. pick from one of the other bajillion interpretations of dragons other than Smaug or Toothless. I just want to see you push your writing muscles a bit and not just go with something you already know, I want to see you at least have to google a bit.

* Task one: Write a story involving a mythical creature.

Obviously more than one mythical creature is also allowed...

For your second task... **stop right here... stop... don't keep reading...**

**Well okay, read this bit but stop at the end of this paragraph.** I'm actually going to give you two choices for your second mod task this month, but before you can read any further you need to have already decided on your own self-set tasks. I'm not going to make you write them on the sub or anything, you can have them in your own head and pinky promise you've got them planned before continuing. But until you know your self-set tasks, no more Tasks post for you.

Go on. Go get them done. I'll be waiting.

Okay. You thought up your self-set tasks? Cool. You have two options for your second mod task this month. You can either:

* &gt;!Go through your old Talking Tuesday tasks and find one you failed at and set yourself the task of completing it this month!&lt;

or

* &gt;!Take one of your self-set tasks for this month and turn up the hardness by 50%!&lt;

What exactly an increase in hardness means is up to you. Just make it more uncomfortable and daunting somehow. Basic jist, if you take this second route, there are two points on offer. One point for doing the ordinary version of your self-set task, and one point for doing the hard version. It's like when you get the gold award in a computer game.

Obviously, you also have your own self-set tasks as well. Two of them.

# P.S. August is Weird

The general rule of Talking Tuesday Tasks is once the tasks post is up you have till the next Tutoring post to report back on your former tasks and set yourself new tasks. However, August is a five-Tuesday month. So you actually have two whole weeks to do it instead of the usual one. That gives you till the 6th September to respond below.

Of course the later you leave it to repost back on your old tasks and set new ones, then the less time you have to complete next month's. So you know. [Decide wisely.](https://c.tenor.com/DU_OBlnc6m4AAAAC/indiana-jones-last-crusade.gif)
