##This Week’s Challenge

&amp;nbsp;

It has been requested a few times and after going on a bit of a food journey, my wanderlust isn't satiated this summer just yet! This  month we'll be revisiting a topic I enjoy a whole bunch: Architecture. The way we build and design the structures that fill our lives often says a lot about us. What we value at the time, sure, but in the context of what came before, we can see what is being reacted to. There are signs of the times in these designs. For instance the changeover from Art Deco that celebrated intricate detailed machining and repeated patterns to the aerodynamic shapes of Streamline Moderne mimicked our attention to aviation and aerodynamics. So come along as we explore 4 different types of architecture and allow it to inspire you. Make stories using the style as locations or take cues from what they were about to make your narratives! I'm excited to see what you all do.

&amp;nbsp;

After landing in Tokyo, you had grabbed the Tokaido shinkansen line headed to Kyoto. Some might say it is a bit touristy of a mood, but the truth is that without a fluent interpreter going to Nagano or Okayama might prove too difficult. You could probably just get by in Kyoto, and there was plenty to see to sate your appetite for design. Traditional structures of various time periods are everywhere in Japan’s cultural center. Its time serving as capital, home of royalty, and center for shogunates afforded it this status. Your interest here was a style of architecture refined over centuries: [Shoin-Zukuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoin-zukuri)

&amp;nbsp;

Moving from the palatial grounds you find a few smaller residences. They were so meticulously well kept and mixed in with tourist sites you almost walked right through the front gate onto private property. You look at the [simple design](https://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shoinzukuri.htm) from afar: square timbers at right angles make the basis of the structure. A dramatic sloped tiled roof caps the building, perfect for allowing rain and snow to runoff and away. Large outdoor hallways act as a barrier between the interior and a carefully manicured garden. 

&amp;nbsp;

Later you find an actual estate ready for the gawking of a tourist. Paper doors diffuse light gently, the aroma of the gardens fill the house, the tatami mats underfoot muffle footsteps. The building forced its residents to acknowledge and live with nature. It was not a hard separation from the outside world. Up close you can see the exquisite joinery work that held the structure together. More than a simple mortise and tenon, complex angles spread the strain of the load in many directions. It allowed for more elasticity, perfect for surviving earthquakes. You get lost in your thoughts reflecting on the trip and bracing for the final leg of your journey to come.
