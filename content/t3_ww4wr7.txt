I have just done what people have only dreamed about, in works of fiction. I have brought someone back to life.
My wife. I brought my wife back to life. But, she is not the same. Not at all.
Everything is working. Her brain, all of her organs. But, she just sits there, stairing off into nothingness.
I have tried numerous sensory tests, but she barely responds to any of them outwardly. Inwardly, her brain lit up like it was supposed to. I poked her with a needle, and her brain registered pain, and her reflexes made her body flinch. But, she did not react otherwise. No cry of pain, no "ouch." Nothing. I tried putting on her favorite music, too. But, her brain only reacts to the noise. Same with the music she hates. I tried to get her to watch some of her favorite movies, but there was no response, except for the brain regestering the bright colors, and movement.
She doesn't learn either. Her brain will regester hunger. But, when you put food in her mouth, she doesn't chew. I have since put in a feeding tube. She can stand, somewhat. But, I have to physically move her legs for her to walk.
For all intents and purposes, she's a walking vegetable.  There are no signs that she is thinking. I've created life, but the soul is still dead.
And now I don't know what to do. Should I let her live out her life as a mindless husk of who she used to be? Can I bring myself to end her life? What is the ethical choice?
