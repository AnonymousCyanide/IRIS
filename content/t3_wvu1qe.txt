I've always had a crush on this girl but we graduated a few years ago and I never had the courage to ask her out. Fast forward to a week ago when I saw a post of hers on Facebook. I clicked on her profile just out of curiosity and saw that her relationship status was single. I'm single as well, but not looking for a relationship right now.

So I sent her a message to ask how she was doing and we exchanged a few messages just talking about our lives and such. Then I asked her if she was really single and she said yeah why. I basically said that I always found her attractive and would love to have sex with her if she was interested. I wanted to be honest and blunt about my intentions (other redditors have reported using this approach successfully.) I let her know it was no big deal if she wasn't interested.

She said "why would you even ask that" and blocked me. I've been thinking about it for the last week and I'm kicking myself that I said that. I really wish I could go back in time and redo that whole conversation. I know that I came off as creepy and it makes me cringe just to think about it.

TL;DR: I asked my high school crush if she would have hook up with me and she blocked me.
