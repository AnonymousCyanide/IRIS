Eric Tamiyasu was a forty-one year old man who lived in Hood River, Oregon. He lived in a rural area outside of town next to the fruit orchards that he "owned and operated," (according to Unsolved Mysteries), and so these fruit orchards were Eric's primary source of income. In June of 2001, Eric invited his friend Diana Anderson over to his house for a date. While they were trying to enjoy their evening , they kept hearing odd noises outside, such as tapping (although it's something been referred to as banging or knocking) outside the house, and then someone rang the doorbell twice but when Eric went to answer it there was no one there--but both Eric and Diana did hear someone running away.

At some point, Eric got understandably annoyed and frustrated by all of this so her and Diana decided to go outside and check out what was going on. Eric and Diana found a footprint outside in the dirt, but it was soon washed away when it rained. After this, Diana decided that she'd better go on home, so Eric walked her to her car and said good-bye. After this date with Diana, no one would see or hear from Eric Tamiyasu for about a week.

A business acquaintance of Eric's named Don Dixon (although Dixon would claim that Eric was one of his good friends) went to go check on Eric at his house. Don said he'd been worried that he hadn't heard from Eric in a few days, so he went out to his house. First he rang the doorbell and knocked--no answer...then he got the spare key (Unsolved Mysteries is confusing here because their segment said that Don *had* a key for some reason) to open the house. At first nothing seemed outwardly wrong, but then Don would then discover Eric dead in his bedroom, where it was obvious that he'd been dead for a while.

Don called the police, and afterwards he called Eric's sister Ramona (why he had Ramona's phone number is unclear) and told her something to the effect: *"he didn't find exit wounds on the body."* Ramona, obviously, found this to a weird and disturbing thing to say. Don Dixon claimed that he'd *"looked closely at the body,"* and thought it must've been a suicide because he was found in bed. Still a bizarre thing to say to a dead man's sister though, especially over the phone.

So the sheriff's name was Joe Wampler, and he did some questionable things as well. Wampler, at first, thought it was natural causes so he asked Don Dixon to bur Eric's bedding and the bed itself. This was to "spare the family," having to see it and because Eric was decomposed it was hard to determine what happened at first...or something. However, at autopsy, it was discovered that Eric had been shot **several times in the head!** After this, it became clear that it was not natural or a suicide. Now the bed couldn't be used for any kind of evidence because the Sheriff decided to have it burned. Although Wampler did later apologize for having this done, which is something I guess.

Okay onto the suspects: We have four main suspects. Don Dixon who found the body, Sheriff Joe Wampler for burning the bed and may have been covering something up, Eric Smith a friend of the victim who had an argument with Eric Tamiyasu and Diana Anderson ex-boyfriend/ex-husband (it's unclear whether the guy was a boyfriend or husband).

Eric Smith--the friend--didn't seem to have a motive to kill Eric, and "argument," they apparently had was only overheard by Don Dixon, who shared an office space with the other men and it had been about money . But Eric Smith said there was no argument, and although the two Erics did have a business together at one point, no large amount of money was owed or anything like that. The two Erics did actually seem like good friends, Eric Tamiyasu was in Eric Smith's wedding (with photos to prove it).

Sheriff Joe Wampler decided to have the bed burned and according to Don Dixon (yes, again) Eric was apparently "dating," an older Polynesian woman--who fit the description of Wampler's wife. Wampler, however, says that his wife was NOT having an affair and he did apologize for the bed burning incident. Also, he literally has no motive and the sheriff wouldn't go around killing someone, it doesn't make sense (at least to me).

There's not much information about Diana's ex....the only motive we're presented with is that he was jealous that Diana was moving on. There's also speculation that he was the one making all the knocking noises on the night of the date.

Finally, we have Don Dixon. Don is the one who started the ball rolling on all of these other suspects, making the claims (or rumors about everyone else). He found the body, made the weird call to Eric's sister and there's no clear evidence that he and Eric were actually friends. Eric Smith claimed that Don was someone that Eric only *"bought spray from."* While I don't know if Don actually did anything, he really was acting strangely about the case. There's a news segment which I'll link to where Don is STILL talking about the case as if he and Eric were BFFs.

Sorry for the long post. I think this case has always bothered me because it was someone who was found dead in their own bed, which is scary. So what are your thoughts? I also don't know if what happened during the date with Diana had anything to do with Eric's death (even Diana admits this).
