I saw a [local news article](https://www.kait8.com/2022/08/21/church-group-looking-forward-after-historic-vote/) regarding a local United Methodist Church (UMC) voting for disaffiliation from that religious organization. I followed sourced news articles from that one [here](https://www.kait8.com/2022/08/01/historic-vote-results-church-disaffiliation-are/) and [here](https://www.kait8.com/2022/08/21/church-group-looking-forward-after-historic-vote/). I did a search and it looks like there many UMCs looking for disaffiliation, an [example](https://www.umnews.org/en/news/large-texas-churches-vote-on-disaffiliation). It appears to be over some LGBTQ issues but many other articles I have read are confusing. They say the UMC's current doctrine bans LGBTQ inclusion but this is the reason for disaffiliation votes. What's going on?
