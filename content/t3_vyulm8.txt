**"You are on the fastest available route,"** the demon on my shoulder chirped. "At the next Worldtree offshoot, turn left."

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, working on it." I adjusted the jets of wind that kept me from falling into the twinkling haze of green motes beneath me, angling towards the massive, spiraling tree trunk that descended towards the core of the world. Delivering packages between dimensions wasn't for every courier, but for those that could traverse the planes, it turned out you could do significantly better than a straight line when it came to getting from point A to point B. 

"In 300 feet, turn left." The parrot-demon on my shoulder paused. "Turn left."

"Ah, yes, very helpful," I muttered. "Because I didn't hear you the first two times." 

The demon made no response. It wasn't truly sentient—just an engineered collection of soul fragments designed to navigate routes between planes. Very *poorly* designed, but it was more convenient than having nothing at all. I held out a hand, feathers in my soul transitioning into gusts of wind, and coasted around the Worldtree, ruffling the carpet of sparks beneath me as I passed. Although the Plane of Elemental Regrowth had no solid ground, the scenery was still beautiful, every mote of life in realspace reflected as glowing sparks as far as the eye could see. The pitch-black sky combined with the dim rivers of light below made for an eerie twilight, a sea of light I skimmed on in passing on my quest.

"In 400 feet, open a rift," the demon squawked, and I snapped back to attention. This was the important part; the various planes weren't shaped quite the same, and without the demon's help, I would have no idea what part of thoughtspace corresponded to my destination in realspace. 

"In 300 feet, open a rift."

"In 200 feet, open a rift."

"In 100 feet, open a rift."

Okay, that being said, I could do with fewer reminders. The first one was more than enough, thank you very much.

"Open a rift," the demon said, and I obliged, reaching into my soul. Vines of forgiveness, carefully grown in the fertile mud of regret and watered with dewdrops of joy, surged forth into the world, dissolving the boundaries between one reality and the next. The gentle green of the Plane of Elemental Regrowth gave way to a log cabin in fields of amber grain. The sea of sparks beneath me corresponded to the waves of grain below, so... that must have meant that the two dense clouds of light within the building were the family I was delivering my package to. I took a quick peek into soulspace to check—just long enough to verify that those were indeed human souls—and then withdrew my soulsight, firing off another jet of wind to slip through the rift. 

I flicked a few droplets of acid-green spite at the rift, and the directionally-opposed energies clashed, collapsing the rift behind me. Any traces of residual magic would fade within the hour. I stepped up to the cabin door and knocked.

"Mail delivery! Meat pies for..." I scanned the tag on the package. Chryvik. Ugh, I hated Crystal Coast names. "Try-vik?" I tried. 

There was a momentary pause, and then the door burst open. A rather pretty young farmer opened the door, giving me a dazzling smile.

"I'll take that, thank you very much."

I shrugged. "Alright, just sign here for confirmation of receipt," I said, handing over a thin pencil and a strip of paper. 

She nodded, scribbling something on the paper, then held out her hand for the package. I exchanged it for the receipt and turned to leave, opening another rift into the Plane of Elemental Regrowth. Through the rift, the amber grass became clouds of sparks, the lonely oak became a towering Worldtree...

...and the larger of the two human-sized lights stomped towards the smaller one, shoving them over and sending them scraping across the ground.

I flinched, turning around, then looked down at the receipt.

The signature was messy and nearly illegible, but at a glance, I could tell that it did *not* spell Chryvik.

"You are on the fastest available route," the demon said. "Turn right at the next Worldtree offshoot."

I set my jaw, walked through the rift, and doubled back towards the log cabin, waving the rift closed as an afterthought.

"Warning: You are deviating from your assigned path. Recalculating. You are deviating from your assigned path. Recalculating."

"Story of my life, little guy," I said, giving the demon a pat on the head. Approaching the two towers of light, I opened a thumb-sized rift into realspace, letting sound and light peek through—

"You *insolent* little brat!" The farmer who'd greeted me at the door screeched. They didn't sound so pretty now. "That was a *week's* worth of wages you just wasted on delivery—and for what? Some *meat?* Is the grain I make not good enough for you?"

"I—I'm sorry, Mommy, I just—I was so—so hungry, and—I—" The scratchy, hiccuping voice in the corner sniffed, and I froze.

That was the voice of a goblin.

"Ungrateful bastard, I should drown you before you eat me out of house and home!" The farmer's voice snapped me out of my memories, and I narrowed my eyes. One cluster of light frantically scooted back while the other hefted the child up by the front of their shirt. "Why don't I just drop you down the well, you useless little—"

"Goblins are obligate carnivores," I politely said, widening the rift and stepping through.

Everyone in the room froze. Inside, the cabin was dim and dirty, caked with grime and refuse. I wrinkled my nose at the smell.

"What?" The farmer asked, turning towards me with an expression of polite bafflement. As if I had bumped into her at market, instead of catching her threatening to drown her child.

"It means they *have* to eat meat, or they die. It isn't a choice. What *is* a choice is being a pathetic, abusive asshole to a starving child." I gave her a sunny smile. "A choice I see you've made with quite some gusto."

She balled her fists. "You have *no* right to—"

"Not dealing with this," I decided, tapping her lightly on the nose. In a flash of green sparks, she vanished.

"Wh—what did you—did you *kill* her?" the child whispered.

I shook my head. "Transposed her to the Plane of Elemental Regrowth. It's a gravity-free dimension of healing and life; if she managed to die in there, I'd frankly be impressed." I turned towards the kid and took the package of pies off the counter, handing them to the kid. "Want me to do something about that bruise of yours?" I asked.

The kid flinched. "It—it's already enough, don't you think?"

Oh, child. "That's not what I meant. Here." I reached into my soul, for the vines of forgiveness that threaded through me, and delicately brushed one against the kid's cheek. Opening so many rifts in quick succession had nearly ran me dry, but I had enough to perform one simple spell.

Regrowth.

The child blinked in surprise as their flesh knit itself back together, disbelievingly feeling at their cheek, then looked up at me with wide eyes.

"Thank you," they whispered.

I nodded. "No problem, kid. Let me get your mother back—and I'll swing by tomorrow to make sure everything's okay."

The kid nodded, fidgeting, then whispered, "Could I... could I go with you?"

I blinked.

They wilted. "If—if it's allowed. I don't want to hurt you. I just..."

"Yeah. Yeah, kid, I can take you in for a bit. Come on."

And I took their hand and stepped through the rift, leaving with cargo infinitely more precious than what I'd come with.

Rain or shine, sleet or snow, monsters or people or both in one go, nothing would stop me from delivering my packages on time.
