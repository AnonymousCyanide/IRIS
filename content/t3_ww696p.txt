[Paul David Sanders](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2021_37/3506852/paul_sanders_brewer_main_art.png) was born on April 25, 1984, and grew up with his mother and sister in Licking, Missouri, while his father resided in Mesa, Arizona. Paul was wonderful son and brother, and his younger sister, Jessica, referred to him as the family’s protector. Whenever Paul’s mother would meet a new man, and begin to date him, Paul would ensure that his mother was being treated properly. And whenever Jessica was having a bad day, he would be there for her- often defending her and stepping in, if she had been bullied by another kid. He treasured his family and wanted the best for their well-being. Jessica said that since their fathers weren’t in their lives, Jessica looked up to her older brother. 

Paul was also a wonderful athlete, and at the time, was on his way to earning a sports scholarship to college. Jessica stated that Paul had played every sport imaginable, and that scouts would often come to his high school in order to watch him- she mentioned how he had a very bright, promising future ahead of him. 

One of Jessica’s favorite memories of Paul was when the two would make trips together to Blimpie, a local sandwich shop. She recalled how they two would sit inside the shop for hours, eating, talking, and laughing together, and how cool she thought it was to be spending time with her older brother. It’s a memory she now treasures, held close to her heart. 

**The Disappearance** 

In the summer of 2000, Paul had made the decision that he wanted to spend time with his father, Robert, who lived in Mesa, Arizona. His mother had begged him not to go, but Paul had already decided on the extended trip, and went to stay with his dad, enrolling in school In Globe, Arizona. Initially, Paul stayed at his grandmother’s house in Globe, but then moved into his father’s house in Mesa. Jessica, who was 11 at the time, remembered how her brother used to call home often, asking for help getting back to Missouri- and, he did return for the holiday season that year, but subsequently returned to Arizona in order to finish out his school education. Paul would attend Globe High School for his sophomore year, and was then enrolled into Mesa High School for his Junior year, starting at the end of August, 2001. 

On the night of August 11, 2001, Paul and his father got into an argument at their home, which was located in the 3800 block of East Carol Circle. This prompted Paul to leave the residence in the early morning hours of August 12, where he proceeded to drive to visit his grandmother, in Globe, Arizona, driving his father’s silver Chevy pick up truck. He was last seen after leaving his grandma’s house, but there is no word of who he was seen by after leaving, or where. 

On August 12th, the Chevy truck was pulled over by highway patrol for a minor traffic violation, in Tucson, Arizona- roughly 1 hour and 45 minutes from Mesa. Before the officer could establish the identity of the driver, the Chevy sped off, and a high speed chase ensued along Route 77. This chase started in Mammoth, Arizona, and came to a halt around Oracle Junction. The chase was called off, however, due to one of the police vehicles running into the stop sticks they had placed on the ground in order to stop the vehicle. The Chevy, and it’s unknown driver, had gotten away. 

Days later, on August 15th, the truck had been discovered, abandoned, crashed into the side of a steep hill in the Santa Catalina Mountains. The area the truck was found was very remote. Left behind in the truck was Paul’s wallet, cell phone, and driver’s license, under the driver’s seat. The car keys had been left on the center console. Jessica later learned that Paul had cashed a check from his work, the day before, but the cash he had withdrawn when he deposited this check was not in his wallet. The items in Paul’s truck were not deemed to be evidence, for some reason, and they were subsequently tossed out the car window by Paul’s father. Robert also removed and threw away all of Paul’s personal items from their home. 

Paul has never been seen, nor heard from, again. 

**The Investigation And A Sister’s Determination** 

The missing persons report, and subsequent case, was taken on by the Mesa Police Department. It is unclear what the MPD had uncovered about Paul’s disappearance in the years since, but Jessica has dug into the case in order to find answers about her brother’s disappearance. She had contacted the lead investigator, Larissa Valdez, who has been on the case since 2019, and updated her (Jessica’s) name as the point of contact, and brought the case back to light through social media. She has also filed for a FOIA requests across a handful of different agencies, in order for her and her team to learn more about Paul’s disappearance. 

Through Jessica and her team’s investigation, she was able to get in contact with both Paul’s father, as well as old friend’s of Paul’s in Arizona. This led to stories about Paul possibly having been caught up with the wrong crowd, as well as discrepancies around the last days that Paul was seen. There was also rumor about Paul potentially trying to get away from some trouble that he had run into, which may have led to his disappearance. However, Jessica firmly believes that her brother wouldn’t have left on his own accord, saying: 

&gt; *”He wouldn’t have left us to wonder. He wouldn’t have left us broken-hearted. He was our protector.”* 

**Closing** 

Paul Sanders has been missing for 21 years, this month. During that time, his father, Robert, has had a handful of run ins with the law. He had committed a string of [bank robberies](https://www.eastvalleytribune.com/local/police-mad-hatter-bank-robber-arrested/article_20214a40-4441-5263-b4a3-a3f38b619890.html) across the valley, where he would wear a different hat during each one, which earned him the media nickname “The Mad Hatter.” In 2009, Robert confessed to these robberies, and had been arrested at his mother’s home in Globe. Due to Robert’s request, all communication regarding the disappearance of his son has ceased. 

Paul’s mother dealt with extreme heartbreak over losing her son, and not knowing what had happened to him. Jessica said it broke her mother, and ultimately killed her. After years of not knowing what happened to her son, and telling Jessica that she just wanted to be with Paul, her mother took her own life in July of 2020. Jessica claimed that this shattered her world, once again, but despite how much she wanted to give up, she became even more determined to find out what happened to her brother that August day in 2001. 

Jessica had set up a Facebook page in order to remember her brother by, and the comments left by others who knew him have helped her through her difficult time. Many people shared sports stories of Paul, but a few detailed how genuine and caring Paul truly was, with one poster saying: 

&gt; *”Paul was the first boy to ever buy me jewelry! He bought me a ring when we were in the 5th grade. He hid it behind my mouse when we were in computer class! It was so sweet!”*

When last seen, Paul was described as standing at 5’8” and weighing 145 pounds. He has brown hair and hazel eyes, and has the name “Hernandez” tattooed on the center of his back. Paul may use the last names Brewer, Hernandez, or Sanders-Brewer. He was last seen wearing a medium blue t-shirt with the word "Billabong" across the front, dark-colored denim shorts and white K-Swiss shoes.
